Objectives
In this assignment, you will create the About Us page (aboutus.html) for the Bootstrap website you've been working on. The starter code will be provided for you. 
Using what you have learned this week, you will configure the About Us page to use Bootstrap, implement the Bootstrap grid system to display the content using row and column classes.
You will research and use two new Bootstrap classes to responsively hide content for extra small screens in both your HTML files.

Instructions
Read the workshop assignment instructions on this page and watch the video, but do not start the assignment until you are at the in-person workshop.
You will submit your assignment at the bottom of this page.


Task 1
Create a new file in your Bootstrap course project folder (that is, the nucampsites folder in your Bootstrap folder) and name it aboutus.html. Copy and paste the following starter content (or you can download the file via this link):
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <!-- Required meta tags always come first -->
    <meta charset="utf-8" />

        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-4 col-sm-2 offset-1">
                    <h5>Links</h5>
                    <ul class="list-unstyled">

           </div>
        </div>
    </footer>

</body>

</html>
As you did in index.html, now:
In the head element, add a link to the bootstrap.min.css, the Lobster font from Google, and the styles.css file.
At the bottom of the body element, Add links to the jquery, popper, and bootstrap JS files.
NOTE: In order to view this page, use npm start from your bash terminal inside the project folder as you have done before. Then, in the address bar where it says "http://localhost:3000/" - add "aboutus.html" to the end so that it says "http://localhost:3000/aboutus.html" and you will be able to see the file. In Week 2, you will be adding navigation links to be able to navigate to this page more easily, but this will work for now. 


Task 2
Add formatting to the web page using the Bootstrap grid's container, row, and column classes.
Make sure that:
The “About Us” title and the "Community Partners" section both stretch across the entire width of their row.
The “Our Mission” part occupies only half the width of the row for small to extra large screens. 
The "Our Mission" and "Community Partners" content are each inside two divs. For each, the outer div should have both the row and row-content classes applied.
See the screenshots below as your guide. You can either resize your browser window or use your browser's developer tools to get different viewport sizes.








Task 3

In aboutus.html, apply the d-none and d-sm-block Bootstrap responsive classes to the p elements containing the descriptions of the community partners so that they are hidden on only extra small screens.
Read the documentation on these classes here. See how the combination of classes shown here enables you to hide the content for XS screen sizes. 
Also apply these two classes to the three p elements in the body of index.html.
In index.html's footer, in the Links, also update the link to About to point to "aboutus.html" instead of "#". 
Afterward, in a XS viewport, the Community Partners section of your aboutus.html page should look like this:



Files To Upload
