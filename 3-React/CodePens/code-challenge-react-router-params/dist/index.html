<p><strong>First:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Click the Albums link above, then click on Album 1 and Album 2 to observe the behavior.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Code Challenges:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Add an album to the ALBUMSDATA array in the JS section. Hit the Run button, then click the Albums link and see how it's changed. This is a demo of how dynamic routing can work.
  <li>Next, for the real challenge: You are invited to play around with the code and see what you can add - up to you. Some ideas: Add a component that displays albums by year, using a router parameter/match param for the year. Add a Random link that displays a random album. Display the album title along with "Album 1" and "Album 2". Add images and links to lyrics/MP3s... Up to you!</li>
</ol>
