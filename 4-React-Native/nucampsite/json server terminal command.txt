json server terminal command

NOTE 1: Make sure to run this command from within the json-server folder, otherwise it will just create an empty database in the folder you run the script from and you won't have access to your data

NOTE 2: the number after d is the simulated delay in milliseconds.  For a shorter delay, lower that number

 

json-server -H 0.0.0.0 --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 1000
